HELENA
The man has fallen asleep, Primus.
PRIMUS
Yes, I know.
(Examining things on table)
Look, Helena.
HELENA
(crossing to PRIMUS)
All these little tubes! What does he do with them?
PRIMUS
He experiments. Don't touch them.

R. U. R. E-94

HELENA
(looking into microscope)
I've seen him looking into this. What can he see?
PRIMUS
That is a microscope. Let me look.
HELENA
Be very careful.
(Knocks over a test-tube)
Ah, now I have spilled it.
PRIMUS
What have you done?
HELENA
It can be wiped up.
PRIMUS
You have spoiled his experiments.
HELENA
It is your fault. You should not have come to me.
PRIMUS
You should not have called me.
HELENA
You should not have come when I called you.
(She goes to Alquist's writing desk)
Look, Primus. What are all these figures?
PRIMUS
(examining an anatomical book)
This is the book the old man is always reading.
HELENA
I do not understand those things.
(She goes to the window)
Primus, look!
PRIMUS
What?
HELENA
The sun is rising.
PRIMUS
(still reading the book)
I believe this is the most important thing in the world. This
is the secret of life.

R. U. R. E-95
HELENA
Do come here.
PRIMUS
In a moment, in a moment.
HELENA
Oh, Primus, don't bother with the secret of life. What does
it matter to you? Come and look quick ––
PRIMUS
(going to window)
What is it?
HELENA
See how beautiful the sun is rising. And do you hear? The
birds are singing. Ah, Primus, I should like to be a bird.
PRIMUS
Why?
HELENA
I do not know. I feel so strange today. It's as if I were in
a dream. I feel an aching in my body, in my heart, all over
me. Primus, perhaps I'm going to die.
PRIMUS
Do you not sometimes feel that it would be better to die? You
know, perhaps even now we are only sleeping. Last night in my
sleep I again spoke to you.
HELENA
In your sleep?
PRIMUS
Yes. We spoke a strange new language, I cannot remember a
word of it.
HELENA
What about?
PRIMUS
I did not understand it myself, and yet I know I have never
said anything more beautiful. And when I touched you I could
have died. Even the place was different from any other place
in the world.
HELENA
I, too, have found a place, Primus. It is very strange. Human
beings lived there once, but now it is overgrown with weeds.
No one goes there any more –– no one but me.

R. U. R. E-96

PRIMUS
What did you find there?
HELENA
A cottage and a garden, and two dogs. They licked my hands,
Primus. And their puppies! Oh, Primus! You take them in your
lap and fondle them and think of nothing and care for nothing
else all day long. And then the sun goes down, and you feel
as though you had done a hundred times more than all the work
in the world. They tell me I am not made for work, but when I
am there in the garden I feel there may be something –– What
am I for, Primus?
PRIMUS
I do not know, but you are beautiful.
HELENA
What, Primus?
PRIMUS
You are beautiful, Helena, and I am stronger than all the
Robots.
HELENA
(looks at herself in the minor)
Am I beautiful? I think it must be the rose. My hair –– it
only weights me down. My eyes –– I only see with them. My
lips –– they only help me to speak. Of what use is it to be
beautiful?
(She sees PRIMUS in the mirror)
Primus, is that you? Come here so that we may be together.
Look, your head is different from mine. So are your
shoulders –– and your lips ––
(PRIMUS draws away from her)
Ah, Primus, why do you draw away from me? Why must I run
after you the whole day?
PRIMUS
It is you who run away from me, Helena.
HELENA
Your hair is mussed. I will smooth it. No one else feels to
my touch as you do. Primus, I must make you beautiful, too.
PRIMUS grasps her hand.
PRIMUS
Do you not sometimes feel your heart beating suddenly,
Helena, and think: now something must happen?
HELENA
What could happen to us, Primus?
(HELENA puts a rose in Primus's hair. PRIMUS and

HELENA look into mirror and burst out laughing)
Look at yourself.
