Poor Radius, you've caught it, too? Now they'll send you to
the stamping-mill. Couldn't you control yourself? Why did it
happen? You see, Radius, you are more intelligent than the
rest. Dr. Gall took such trouble to make you different. Won't
you speak?
RADIUS
Send me to the stamping-mill.
HELENA
But I don't want them to kill you. What was the trouble,
Radius?

RADIUS
I won't work for you. Put me into the stamping-mill ––
HELENA
Do you hate us? Why?
RADIUS
You are not as strong as the Robots. You are not as skillful
as the Robots. The Robots can do everything. You only give
orders. You do nothing but talk.
HELENA
But someone must give orders.
RADIUS
I don't want any master. I know everything for myself.
HELENA
Radius, Dr. Gall gave you a better brain than the rest,
better than ours. You are the only one of the Robots that
understands perfectly. That's why I had you put into the
library, so that you could read everything, understand
everything, and then –– oh, Radius, I wanted you to show the
whole world that the Robots are our equals. That's what I
wanted of you.
RADIUS
I don't want a master. I want to be master. I want to be
master over others.
HELENA
I'm sure they'd put you in charge of many Robots, Radius. You
would be a teacher of the Robots.
RADIUS
I want to be master over people.
HELENA
(staggering)
You are mad.
RADIUS
Then send me to the stamping-mill.
HELENA
Do you think we're afraid of you?
RADIUS
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?
HELENA
Radius, give this note to Mr. Domin. It asks them not to send
you to the stamping-mill. I'm sorry you hate us so.

DR. GALL enters the room.
